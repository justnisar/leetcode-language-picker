Leetcode contests are *great* way to keep your programming skills sharp. They come as invaluable tools in your toolbox. 

# What does this script do?
This script will add another section called "Language" that shows language choice used for the solution.

# Motivation:
When I finished the contest, I wanted to check solutions of my programming language however, I didn't find an effective way rather than picking every solution and checking each one of them.

# New Features!

  - Show language options on the right.
  - The script only checks for the first question when we display language(s) on the right.

# Next
  - Multi language support.
  - Intuitive UI by displaying Icons.
  - Download / Export to pdf for solutions? If there's any interest.
